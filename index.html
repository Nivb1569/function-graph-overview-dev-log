      <h2>ðŸ“Œ About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Function Graph Overview</strong> is an open-source project that allows developers to generate control flow graphs (CFG) from functions written in various programming languages. 
        It helps visualize the logical structure and execution paths of functions, aiding in analysis and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are <strong>Niv, Alon, and Ben</strong>, computer science students from <strong>The Academic College of Tel Avivâ€“Yaffo</strong>, working together to contribute to this project as part of our open-source learning journey.

        In this blog, weâ€™ll post a dedicated entry for each <em>GitHub issue</em> we work on. Each post will explain what the issue is about, what it adds or fixes, the challenges we faced, and how we solved them. We'll include code snippets, screenshots, and technical explanations.  
        When relevant, weâ€™ll also link directly to the issue on GitHub.
